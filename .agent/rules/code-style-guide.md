# Core Tenets
- Add to `TODO.md` all the time. If there's a new TODO, it MUST be in `TODO.md`
- There are zero users. Actively IGNORE preserving backwards compatibility.
- If you are not sure about something, PLEASE ASK instead of catastrophically failing by risking trying the wrong thing
- Use `??`, not `||`, for fallbacks
- Deliberate slowly and thoroughly on matters that require more care/attention.
- Avoid `any` whenever possible. It is the equivalent of `NaN` for the type system - it is infectious.
- One thing at a time: Finish **one feature** at a time. Because you are in 'Agent Decides' mode, please **stop** once a feature is finished so the user can make a git commit.
- Optimize for modularity. Anything that makes sense as a plugin should be a plugin; dependencies per module should be minimal - dependencies for optional functionality should be in plugins.
- For `apps/web` and `apps/playground`, use BEM in `packages/shared/src/index.css` instead of inline CSS.
- Always write tests whenever possible. Run with `bun test --coverage` and try to maximize coverage.
- Always clean up long comments. Use `rg` with `//.+\n *//.+\n *//`.
- Try to avoid `ts-expect-error`, but even that is preferable to `ts-ignore`.

# Style
- Avoid one-letter names. `i` -> `idx`; `e` -> `event`; `a, b` -> `left, right`; `parameters.map(p => p)` -> `parameters.map(parameter => parameter)`
- Avoid `++` and `--`. Use `+= 1` and `-= 1` instead.
- We do `bun check:types`, not `bun typecheck`

# Stack
- bun (`bun test`; `bun install <package>` etc)
- bun:sqlite for DB
- vitepress for docs (`docs/`)
- vite for web (`apps/web/` and `apps/playground/`)

## Advice
- When starting a conversation, check `docs/` for design documents. After every action, update the files in `docs/` if there are any relevant updates.
- Add one-shot scripts in `scratch/` subdirectories if possible.
- The scripting language for this has a spec in `docs/scripting_spec.md`. Update this file when adding new functionality; refer to this file when writing AND debugging scripts.
- IPC between servers and clients/frontends uses WebSocket and JSON-RPC.

## Style Guide
- For background colors, prefer transparency - this means light colors with low transparency on dark mode, and dark colors with low transparency on light mode.

## Overarching Goal
- A fully scriptable, modular, flexible platform to manipulate objects
  - Game world (LambdaMOO https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LambdaMOO)
  - Note taking (Notion)
  - AI Chatbots (SillyTavern https://github.com/SillyTavern/SillyTavern)
  - AI World (Talemate https://github.com/vegu-ai/talemate)
- Highly modular - every component should be embeddable and frontend agnostic
